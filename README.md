## The Problem

Every AI coding tool has its own rule format — `.claude/rules/*.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.codex/AGENTS.md`. You end up maintaining the same rules in multiple places, and they inevitably drift apart. On top of that, every prompt loads all your rules, wasting tokens on irrelevant context.

A [recent study from ETH Zurich](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11988) (138 repos, 5,694 PRs) confirms this: **loading all rules at once hurts performance by ~3% and increases cost by 20%+.** Even hand-written context files only helped by 4% — and only when kept under 30 lines. The takeaway: less is more, and only relevant rules should be loaded per prompt.

## The Solution

**ai-nexus** lets you write rules once and distribute them across all your tools — while keeping token usage minimal with smart rule loading:

```
Write once:
  config/rules/commit.md
  config/skills/react.md

Deploy everywhere:
  ✓ Claude Code  → .claude/rules/ (with semantic routing)
  ✓ Cursor       → .cursor/rules/*.mdc (auto-converted)
  ✓ Codex        → .codex/AGENTS.md (aggregated)

One source of truth. Every tool in sync.
Only relevant rules loaded per prompt.
```

## Why ai-nexus?

| | Benefit | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Only relevant rules loaded** | Hundreds of rules installed, only 2-3 loaded per prompt | Semantic Router analyzes your prompt and picks just the rules you need. No unnecessary context = better AI responses + less token waste. |
| **Write once, deploy everywhere** | One rule file → three tools | Write a single `.md` rule. ai-nexus auto-converts to `.mdc` for Cursor and `AGENTS.md` for Codex. No more copy-pasting. |
| **AI-powered rule selection** | GPT-4o-mini or Claude Haiku picks rules for you | A hook runs on every prompt, loading only what you need. Costs ~$0.50/month. Falls back to keyword matching with zero cost. |
| **Team-wide consistency** | Git-based rule sharing | Everyone installs from the same repo. `npx ai-nexus update` keeps the whole team in sync. |
| **Your edits are safe** | Non-destructive updates | Install and update never overwrite your local customizations. Only new files are added. |
| **Community marketplace** | Browse, install, remove — from your browser | `npx ai-nexus browse` opens a local web UI. Community rules are available instantly after PR merge. |

## Supported Tools

| Tool | How it works | Token overhead |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Claude Code** | Semantic Router dynamically swaps rules per prompt | Only relevant rules loaded |
| **Cursor** | Converts rules to `.mdc` format; Cursor's built-in search handles filtering | Depends on Cursor's search |
| **Codex** | Aggregated `AGENTS.md` (rules merged into single file) | All rules loaded |

---

## How It Works

### Claude Code: Semantic Router

A hook runs on every prompt, analyzing what rules you actually need:

```
~/.claude/
├── hooks/
│   └── semantic-router.cjs   # Runs on each prompt
├── settings.json             # Hook configuration
├── rules/                    # Active rules
└── rules-inactive/           # Parked rules (not loaded)
```

**With AI routing** (optional):
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx        # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
export SEMANTIC_ROUTER_ENABLED=true
```

GPT-4o-mini or Claude Haiku analyzes your prompt and picks the right rules. Cost: ~$0.50/month. Requires explicit opt-in.

> **Full setup guide:** [Semantic Router Setup](https://jsk9999.github.io/ai-nexus/docs.html#semantic-router-setup) — provider selection, environment variables, custom models, and verification.

**Without AI** (default):
Keyword matching activates rules based on words in your prompt. Zero cost, no API key needed.

### Cursor: Rule Converter

ai-nexus converts `.md` rules to Cursor's `.mdc` format, adding `description` and `alwaysApply` metadata automatically:

```markdown
---
description: Git commit message conventions and best practices
alwaysApply: false
---

# Commit Rules
...
```

After conversion, **Cursor's built-in semantic search** handles rule filtering — ai-nexus does not run a router for Cursor. The value is unified rule management: write rules once, use them across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex.

### Codex: Aggregated Rules

Individual rule files are aggregated into a single `AGENTS.md` file, which is loaded at session start. No dynamic loading.

> **Codex users: select only the rules you need.** Since all rules are loaded every session, installing too many wastes tokens. Use the interactive wizard (`npx ai-nexus install`) to pick only relevant categories and files. Recommended starting set: `rules/essential.md`, `rules/commit.md`, `rules/security.md`.

## Team Rules

Share rules across your team via Git:

```bash
# Everyone installs from the same source
npx ai-nexus install --rules github.com/acme/team-rules

# When rules are updated
npx ai-nexus update
```

### Creating a Rules Repository

```
team-rules/
├── config/
│   ├── rules/           # Core rules (essential.md, security.md)
│   ├── commands/        # Slash commands (/commit, /review)
│   ├── skills/          # Domain knowledge (react.md, rust.md)
│   ├── agents/          # Sub-agents (code-reviewer.md)
│   ├── contexts/        # Context files (@dev, @research)
│   ├── hooks/           # semantic-router.cjs
│   └── settings.json    # Claude Code hook config
└── README.md
```

### Rule Format

```markdown
---
description: When to load this rule (used by semantic router)
---

# Rule Title

Your rule content...
```

---

## Update & Local Priority

Rules are installed as independent copies. Your customizations are always safe:

- **Existing files are never overwritten** during install or update
- Only new files from source are added
- `npx ai-nexus update` syncs new rules from the latest package
- Use `--force` to override (backup first!)

```bash
# This will NOT overwrite your custom commit.md
npx ai-nexus update

# This WILL overwrite everything
npx ai-nexus update --force
```

> **Migrating from symlink mode?** Just run `npx ai-nexus update` — symlinks are automatically converted to copies.

## Network & Privacy

ai-nexus runs locally. Here is a complete list of network requests the tool may make:

| When | Destination | Purpose | Required? |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Semantic routing (per prompt) | `api.openai.com` | AI-powered rule selection via GPT-4o-mini | **Opt-in only** — requires `SEMANTIC_ROUTER_ENABLED=true` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Semantic routing (per prompt) | `api.anthropic.com` | AI-powered rule selection via Claude Haiku | **Opt-in only** — requires `SEMANTIC_ROUTER_ENABLED=true` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `search`, `get`, `browse` | `api.github.com` | Fetch community rule registry | Only when you run these commands |
| `get` | `raw.githubusercontent.com` | Download rule file content | Only when you run `get` |
| `browse` | `localhost:3847` | Local-only HTTP server for marketplace UI | Bound to `127.0.0.1` — not accessible from other machines |
| `install --rules <url>` | Git remote host | Clone a team rules repository | Only when you provide a `--rules` URL |

**No telemetry. No analytics. No external data collection.**

- API keys are read from environment variables only — never stored on disk or logged.
- Your prompts are sent to OpenAI/Anthropic **only** when semantic routing is explicitly enabled. Without it, keyword-based fallback runs entirely offline.
- The `browse` server binds to `127.0.0.1` and is not accessible from the network.

---

## Rule Marketplace

![browse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSK9999/ai-nexus/main/docs/nexus-marketplace.png)

Open the web-based marketplace to search, install, and remove rules with one click:

```bash
npx ai-nexus browse
```

- Browse community rules with real-time search and category filters
- Install/remove rules directly from the browser
- View tool status (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) and diagnostics
- Runs locally on `http://localhost:3847`

---

## Community Registry

Browse and download community-contributed rules directly from GitHub — no `npm publish` needed.

```bash
# List all available rules
npx ai-nexus search

# Search by keyword
npx ai-nexus search react
```

```
  Results for "react":

  skills/
    react.md - React/Next.js best practices

  1 file(s) found.
  Use "ai-nexus get <filename>" to download.
```

```bash
# Download a rule
npx ai-nexus get react.md

# Specify category when name exists in multiple
npx ai-nexus get commit.md --category commands
```

Rules are downloaded from the [latest GitHub repo](https://github.com/JSK9999/ai-nexus/tree/main/config) to `~/.claude/`. Anyone can contribute new rules via PR — they become available to `search` and `get` immediately after merge.

---
